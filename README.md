# The 1st Scientific Figure Captioning (SciCap) Challenge

Welcome to the 1st Scientific Figure Captioning (SciCap) Challenge! This challenge brings fun and innovation to the world of research, AI, NLP, and CV by combining these fields to create computational models for generating useful text for visuals. Hosted in the 5th Workshop on Closing the Loop Between Vision and Language at ICCV 2023 (Paris, France), the SciCap Challenge features *cash prizes* for the best-performing models!

You'll have access to an astounding 400,000 scientific figure images from various arXiv papers, along with their respective captions and relevant paragraphs. Your mission is to leverage this data to build models capable of generating accurate and informative captions for these images.

## Challenge Structure 🚀

The challenge follows a two-phase structure: the **Test Phase** and the **Challenge Phase**.

- **Test Phase**: Lasts approx. 2.5 months, where you build and test models using the provided training set, validation set, and **public test set**.
- **Challenge Phase**: Takes place over the final 2 weeks before the submission deadline. A **hidden test set** is released, and you'll submit your results for this set.

Winning teams will be determined based on their best results for the hidden test set.
