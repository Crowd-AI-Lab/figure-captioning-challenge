# The 1st Scientific Figure Captioning (SciCap) Challenge

Welcome to the 1st Scientific Figure Captioning (SciCap) Challenge! This challenge brings fun to the world of research, AI, NLP, and CV. It's your chance to participate in building computational models for generating useful text for visuals. The challenge will be hosted in the 5th Workshop on Closing the Loop Between Vision and Language at ICCV 2023 (Paris, France) and has *cash prizes* up for grabs!

Get ready to play with a whopping 400,000 scientific figure images from various arXiv papers and their corresponding captions and relevant paragraphs. The game is simple; use these data to build models that generate captions for these images.

## Prizes üéâ

There will be two winners: the **Leaderboard Winner ($300 USD)** (highest automatic evaluation score across the entire hidden test set) and the **Quality Winner ($300 USD)** (best automatic evaluation score from a human-curated subset of the hidden test set that contains higher-quality captions).

So, are you ready to join the fun in the 1st SciCap Challenge? Head over to the [challenge page](https://github.com/Crowd-AI-Lab/figure-captioning-challenge), grab the data, and dive into the action! Remember to submit your results to [Eval.AI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2012/overview) before the deadline and provide a report (2-4 pages) detailing your system using the ICCV 2023 paper template.

For questions about the challenge, feel free to email us at [**scicap-challenge@googlegroups.com**](mailto:scicap-challenge%40googlegroups.com).

Good luck, and may the best captioning model win! üèÜ
