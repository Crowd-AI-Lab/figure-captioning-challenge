        "Since j m,n increases monotonically with n, we must take n = 1 to minimize T . Thus the optimal streamlines pattern displays a single cell in the radial direction. It is then a simple matter of enumerating the zeros j m,1 to find that the integrated mean exit time is minimized for (m, n) = (2, 1), independent of the P\u00e9clet number (see Figure 1). The streamline and mean exit time patterns are illustrated in Figure 2."
